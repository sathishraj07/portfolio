                                  After completing trainee Period, I transitioned to an Insurance Domain Project where I primarily work as a Frontend Developer. My responsibilities include building and enhancing user interfaces using React.js, with Redux for state management. I collaborate closely with backend teams to integrate ASP.NET Web API services, backed by a SQL Server database. While my main contribution is on the frontend, Iâ€™ve also gained basic exposure to backend development and API handling within the project.

                                    As a Full Stack Developer during my trainee period, I contributed to a Retail Application project, gaining hands-on experience across both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I worked with React and TypeScript, managing application state using MobX. On the backend, I built and integrated ASP.NET Web APIs using Entity Framework, with PostgreSQL as the database. This role provided me a strong foundation in building scalable, responsive applications and understanding the end-to-end development lifecycle in a production-level environment.
