Hi there! 🚀 I'm a Mechtronics graduate from AGNI College, Chennai, who turned passion into profession as a software engineer at Nova Technology Solutions. 🌐 With over two years of professional experience, my expertise spans from front-end technologies like React.js and JavaScript to essential basic back-end knowledge in Dotnet C# Entity Framework and SQL Server. Are you seeking a developer who not only builds but also understands user psychology and scales your digital solutions effortlessly? 🛠️

Hooked on problem-solving, I’ve successfully developed robust and responsive interfaces, ensuring seamless user experiences across devices. Not just another coder, I root my approach in clear, accessible, and engaging user interactions.

</p>
<p>From developing full-scale e-commerce platforms with user authentication to real-time dynamic food ordering systems, I love tackling challenges and transforming them into digital experiences that speak. My project 'E-COMMERCE' elevated user engagement by integrating advanced features like dynamic cart management and persistent session handling. 🛒

Proudly, my efforts were recognized with the 'Star of the Quarter' award for Q2 2023-2024, underpinning my commitment to excellence and teamwork. 🌟

Let's connect! I’m always open to discussing tech, innovation, or potential collaborations.</p>
